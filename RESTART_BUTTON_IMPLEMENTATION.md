## Restart Button Implementation

### Changes Made

#### 1. Added Restart Button to Debug GUI

- **Location**: Controls tab â†’ Application Controls section
- **Button Text**: "ðŸ”„ Restart Application"
- **Position**: Added in a second row below the existing buttons

#### 2. Implemented Restart Functionality

- **Method**: `restart_application()` - Initiates the restart process
- **Helper Method**: `_perform_restart()` - Performs the actual restart
- **Features**:
  - Logs restart initiation
  - Gracefully shuts down monitoring
  - Starts new application process
  - Exits current process cleanly

#### 3. Restart Process Flow

1. User clicks "ðŸ”„ Restart Application" button
2. `restart_application()` method is called
3. Logs warning message about restart
4. Schedules restart after 500ms delay
5. `_perform_restart()` executes:
   - Stops monitoring thread
   - Closes current GUI
   - Starts new Python process
   - Exits current process

#### 4. Error Handling

- Try/catch blocks for all restart operations
- Fallback error messages with messageboxes
- Graceful handling of missing main app reference

#### 5. Technical Details

- Uses `subprocess.Popen()` to start new process
- Detects if running from Python script or executable
- Proper cleanup of threads and GUI components
- 500ms delay to allow GUI to respond before restart

### Usage

1. Open the Debug GUI
2. Navigate to the "Controls" tab
3. Click "ðŸ”„ Restart Application" in the Application Controls section
4. The application will restart automatically

### Benefits

- Quick restart without manual batch file execution
- Integrated into the debug workflow
- Proper logging of restart actions
- Clean shutdown and startup process
- Easy access from the main GUI interface

The restart button provides a convenient way to restart the entire application from within the debug GUI, making development and testing much more efficient.
