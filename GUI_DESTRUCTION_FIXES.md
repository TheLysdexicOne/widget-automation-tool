## GUI Destruction Error Fixes

### Problem Analysis

The application was crashing with multiple TclError exceptions when the GUI was closed:

- `invalid command name "process_log_queue"` - Process log queue trying to run after GUI destruction
- `invalid command name ".!notebook.!frame3.!labelframe.!frame3.!label2"` - Widget references invalid after destruction
- Background monitoring thread continued trying to update destroyed GUI widgets

### Root Cause

The monitoring thread was still running and attempting to update GUI components after the main window was closed, causing Tkinter to try to access destroyed widgets.

### Solutions Implemented

#### 1. Enhanced `schedule_gui_update()` Method

- **Added**: `winfo_exists()` check before scheduling updates
- **Added**: `_safe_gui_callback()` wrapper for all GUI updates
- **Result**: Prevents scheduling updates to destroyed widgets

#### 2. Protected GUI Update Methods

- **`update_status()`**: Added `winfo_exists()` check for status labels
- **`update_stats()`**: Added `winfo_exists()` check for stats labels
- **`log()`**: Added try/catch for timestamp variable access
- **Result**: Methods fail gracefully when widgets are destroyed

#### 3. Improved `process_log_queue()` Method

- **Added**: GUI existence check before processing
- **Added**: Widget existence check before updating log text
- **Added**: Conditional rescheduling only if GUI still exists
- **Result**: Log processing stops cleanly when GUI is destroyed

#### 4. Enhanced Application Shutdown

- **Added**: Explicit monitoring thread stopping
- **Added**: Thread join with timeout and status reporting
- **Added**: Detailed error reporting for component destruction
- **Result**: Clean shutdown sequence with proper thread management

### Technical Details

#### Safe GUI Callback Pattern

```python
def _safe_gui_callback(self, callback):
    def safe_callback():
        try:
            if self.debug_gui and hasattr(self.debug_gui, "root") and self.debug_gui.root.winfo_exists():
                callback()
        except:
            pass  # Ignore if GUI destroyed
    return safe_callback
```

#### Widget Existence Checks

```python
def update_status(self, key, value):
    try:
        if key in self.status_labels and self.status_labels[key].winfo_exists():
            self.status_labels[key].config(text=str(value))
    except:
        pass  # Ignore if widget is destroyed
```

#### Proper Thread Management

```python
# Stop monitoring first
self.monitoring_active = False

# Wait for monitoring thread to finish
if self.monitoring_thread and self.monitoring_thread.is_alive():
    self.monitoring_thread.join(timeout=3)
```

### Results

✅ **No more TclError exceptions**  
✅ **Clean application shutdown**  
✅ **Proper thread synchronization**  
✅ **GUI updates fail gracefully**  
✅ **Monitoring thread stops cleanly**

### Benefits

- **Stability**: Application no longer crashes when window is closed
- **Reliability**: Background threads handle GUI destruction gracefully
- **Debugging**: Better error reporting during shutdown
- **User Experience**: Clean exit without error messages

The application now handles GUI destruction properly, preventing crashes and providing a professional shutdown experience.
