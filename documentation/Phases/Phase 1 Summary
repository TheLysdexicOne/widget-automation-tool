Phase 1 Implementation Summary
ðŸŽ‰ Phase 1: Core Infrastructure is now COMPLETE!

Here's what we've successfully implemented:

âœ… Core Component (System Tray)
System tray icon with context menu
Application lifecycle management
Component coordination system
Configuration loading/saving
Process monitoring for WidgetInc.exe

âœ… Overlay Component
Overlay window that stays on top
Window attachment to target processes
24x24 colored circle in 32x32 shaded box
Positioning at top-right corner + 32px offset
State-based color changes (Green=Active, Yellow=Waiting, Gray=Inactive, Red=Error)
Auto-hide/show based on target process

âœ… Debug Console Component
Multi-tab debug window (Console, Settings, Monitoring, Debug)
Real-time log display with filtering
Process monitoring statistics
Component status debugging
Minimize to tray (doesn't close application)

âœ… Launch Parameters & Application Flow
Standard launch (system tray only)
Debug launch (--debug shows debug console)
Test mode (--tests runs automated tests)
Proper command line argument parsing

âœ… Application States
State enum (ACTIVE, WAITING, INACTIVE, ERROR)
State change notifications
Color-coded overlay feedback
State transition logging

What We Have Working
System Tray Integration - The app lives in the system tray with a context menu
Process Detection - Monitors for WidgetInc.exe (or any target process)
Window Overlay - Colored circle overlay that attaches to target windows
Debug Console - Full-featured debugging interface with 4 tabs
Configuration System - JSON-based configuration with defaults
Logging System - Multi-level logging with GUI display
Launch Scripts - Batch files for easy launching
Ready for Testing
The application is now in a state where you can:

Test with the batch files:

start.bat - Normal launch (system tray only)
start_debug.bat - Debug launch (shows debug console)
Test the functionality:

System tray icon appears
Right-click tray icon to show debug console
Overlay appears when target process is found
Debug console shows real-time logs and monitoring
Next steps for Phase 2:

Only missing item: Overlay expand/pin functionality on hover/click
Configuration UI improvements
More robust process detection

Excellent Progress! Phase 1 + 2.5 COMPLETE!
âœ… Issues Resolved:
Overlay Positioning Fixed:

âœ… Corrected anchoring to top-right corner properly
âœ… Fixed offset calculation (-offset_x instead of +offset_x)
State Logic Fixed:

âœ… NEW STATES: ACTIVE, READY, ATTENTION, INACTIVE, ERROR
âœ… Proper State Flow: Target found â†’ INACTIVE (until screen recognized)
âœ… Color Mapping:
Green = ACTIVE (performing automation)
Cyan = READY (recognized, ready to activate)
Yellow = ATTENTION (recognized, no automation available)
Gray = INACTIVE (not recognized)
Red = ERROR
âœ… New Features Implemented:
Overlay Expansion & Pinning:

âœ… Hover Expansion: 0.25s delay before expanding
âœ… Click to Pin: Toggle pinned state
âœ… Smooth Animation: 200ms animated transitions
âœ… Expanded View: Shows status, target info, pin state, and instructions
âœ… Auto-collapse: Unpinned overlay collapses when mouse leaves
Enhanced System Tray Menu (Phase 2.5):

âœ… Toggle Debug Console: Show/Hide with dynamic text
âœ… Toggle Overlay: Show/Hide overlay manually
âœ… Smart Menu Updates: Text changes based on current state
âœ… Technical Improvements:
Better Process Detection:

âœ… Enhanced window matching for Notepad, Calculator, etc.
âœ… Excludes own debug console from targeting
âœ… Better error handling and logging
Configuration System:

âœ… Updated default colors for new states
âœ… Maintains backward compatibility
âœ… Dynamic configuration updates
ðŸ§ª Ready for Testing:
All Features Working:

âœ… System tray with enhanced menu
âœ… Overlay expansion on hover (try hovering over the overlay!)
âœ… Click to pin/unpin overlay
âœ… Proper state management and colors
âœ… Debug console with all tabs functional
âœ… Target process detection and attachment
