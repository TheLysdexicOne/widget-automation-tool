## Threading Fix Summary

### Problem

The application was experiencing threading issues because background threads were trying to update GUI elements directly, which is not allowed in Tkinter. All GUI operations must happen in the main thread.

### Errors Fixed

1. **RuntimeError: main thread is not in main loop** - Background thread trying to update overlay
2. **RuntimeError: main thread is not in main loop** - Background thread trying to update debug GUI
3. **TclError: can't invoke "destroy" command** - Threading conflicts during shutdown

### Solution

Added thread-safe GUI updates using `tkinter.after()` method:

#### 1. Added `schedule_gui_update()` method

- Schedules GUI updates to run in the main thread
- Uses `self.debug_gui.root.after(0, callback)` to queue updates
- Includes error handling for destroyed GUI

#### 2. Updated `monitor_minigames()` method

- All GUI updates now use `schedule_gui_update()`
- Wrapped overlay and debug GUI updates in lambda functions
- Added try/catch blocks for safer execution
- Fallback to console logging if GUI not available

#### 3. Fixed `reload_application()` method

- All GUI updates now thread-safe
- Uses scheduled updates for logging and status changes

#### 4. Improved `shutdown()` method

- Added try/catch blocks for component destruction
- Increased timeout for monitoring thread join
- Uses print statements instead of GUI logging during shutdown

### Result

- Application starts without threading errors
- Monitoring thread can safely update GUI elements
- Proper cleanup during shutdown
- No more "main thread is not in main loop" errors

### Key Changes Made

- **Added**: `schedule_gui_update()` method for thread-safe GUI updates
- **Modified**: `monitor_minigames()` to use scheduled updates
- **Modified**: `reload_application()` to use scheduled updates
- **Modified**: `shutdown()` for safer component destruction
- **Technique**: All background thread GUI operations now use `tkinter.after()`

The application now runs stably with proper thread separation between monitoring logic and GUI updates.
