# Widget Automation Tool: Copilot Instructions (AI-Optimized)

## General Coding Standards

- **Aesthetics:** Favor an "industrialesque" look in UI and code structure.
- **Principles:**
  - KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
  - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
  - Explicit is better than implicit
  - Clean, maintainable, and efficient code
  - Make it Work → Make it Right → Make it Fast
- **No Reinventing the Wheel:**
  - Use existing modules/utilities when possible
  - Never duplicate calculation or utility functions
  - Suggest or use external libraries if they fit the need

## Execution

- Always launch via start.bat, start_gui.bat, start_overlay.bat
