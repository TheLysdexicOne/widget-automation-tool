## Application Startup Changes

### Modified Files:

1. **run_app.bat** - Simplified batch file to run GUI directly
2. **src/main.py** - Fixed threading issues with GUI startup

### Changes Made:

#### 1. Updated run_app.bat

- **Before**: Used `start cmd /c` to open a new command prompt window
- **After**: Runs the application directly in the current window
- **Benefit**: No second command prompt window, cleaner startup

#### 2. Fixed GUI Threading in main.py

- **Before**: Started debug GUI in a separate thread (caused "Tcl from different apartment" error)
- **After**: Runs debug GUI in the main thread
- **Benefit**: Proper Tkinter threading, no GUI errors

### Current Behavior:

- Run `run_app.bat` to start the application
- GUI opens directly without extra command prompts
- Debug GUI runs in main thread (no threading issues)
- Application runs properly with both simplified overlay and debug GUI

### Technical Details:

- Removed `debug_thread = threading.Thread(target=self.debug_gui.run, daemon=True)`
- Changed `self.root.mainloop()` to `self.debug_gui.run()`
- Batch file now uses `call .venv\Scripts\activate` instead of `start cmd /c`
- Application initialization happens before GUI loop starts

The application now starts cleanly with just the debug GUI window visible, providing a professional user experience without extra command prompt windows.
