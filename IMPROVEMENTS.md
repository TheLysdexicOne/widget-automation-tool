# Test Runner and Overlay Improvements

## Changes Made

### 1. Overlay Positioning Fix

- **Problem**: Overlay was positioned 32px too high relative to WidgetInc window
- **Solution**: Changed offset from `widget_window.top + 32` to `widget_window.top + 64`
- **Files Modified**: `src/overlay_gui.py` (lines in position_window() and monitor_position())

### 2. Test Runner Ctrl+C Handling

- **Problem**: Tests required multiple Ctrl+C presses to exit and didn't return to menu
- **Solution**: Improved signal handling and menu navigation
- **Changes**:
  - Tests now return to menu instead of exiting completely
  - Single Ctrl+C properly interrupts and returns to menu
  - Added signal handler for graceful shutdown
  - Tests run in loops that allow returning to previous menu level

### 3. Test Menu Navigation

- **Problem**: Tests would exit the entire runner after completion
- **Solution**: Restructured menu system to maintain state
- **Changes**:
  - Main menu stays active after running test categories
  - Overlay test menu returns to main menu after tests
  - Added "Goodbye!" message on proper exit

### 4. Enhanced Test Instructions

- **Added**: Clear instructions for each test type
- **Added**: Better feedback messages during test execution
- **Added**: Consistent messaging about Ctrl+C behavior

## Files Modified

1. `src/overlay_gui.py` - Overlay positioning fix (64px offset)
2. `tests/run_tests.py` - Complete test runner restructure
3. `tests/test_overlay.py` - Improved Ctrl+C handling and test control
4. `tests/simple_overlay_test.py` - Better interrupt handling and cleanup

## Test Results

✅ Overlay now positions correctly with 64px offset
✅ Single Ctrl+C returns to menu (no multiple presses needed)
✅ Tests return to menu instead of exiting runner
✅ All tests maintain proper cleanup and state management
✅ Signal handling prevents abrupt termination

## Usage Examples

### Running Tests

```bash
.\run_tests.bat
```

### Expected Behavior

1. Choose test category (1-3 or 0 to exit)
2. For overlay tests, choose specific test or run all
3. During test: Ctrl+C returns to test menu
4. From test menu: Choose another test or return to main
5. From main menu: 0 exits with "Goodbye!"

### Overlay Testing

- Hover over red circle (expands after 0.25s)
- Click to pin/unpin (golden pin icon appears)
- Watch status changes cycle automatically
- Moves with WidgetInc window when running with main app
